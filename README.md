# React-Practice 🚀

This repository contains a collection of my **daily React practice projects**.  
Each project is a small, self-contained task focused on building and reinforcing core React concepts.

> 📚 This repo is purely for my personal learning, experimentation, and consistency-building in React.

## 📁 Structure

- Each folder inside this repository represents a **separate day’s task**.
- Projects are built using **React.js (Vite or Create React App)** depending on the task.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To develop strong hands-on experience with React.
- To explore both fundamental and intermediate-level concepts.
- To stay consistent with daily practice and build a habit of learning.
